# My Personal Project

## Design Recipe 

**Project Proposal**

*What will the application do?*
- The application acts as a "design recipe" or dictionary of sorts for different coding 
  languages. For example, say I was working on a java project, however, I had forgotten what
  an Arraylist looks like. By using this application, I would type in Arraylist and the 
  application will output first the definition of an Arraylist, and then a code template of an
  Arraylist that the user can copy and paste onto their own project. Furthermore, the user will be able 
  to save their own definitions or code templates into the dictionary, which will allow for quick
  and easy access to these templates. 

*Who will use it?*
- Primarily java beginners and learners.

*Why is this project of interest to you?*
- I'm a really forgetful person and I find myself constantly looking up terms and code tidbits because I've forgotten them
  when I'm working. However, googling these questions tends to get a bit tedious, therefore I thought DesignRecipe could help
  centralize the information I'm looking for.

*PHASE 1: User Stories*
- As a user, I want to search for the definition of a recipe.
- As a user, I want to add a recipe to the DesignRecipe.
- As a user, I want to delete a recipe to the DesignRecipe.
- As a user, I want to see a list of recipes.

*To be completed...*
- Add more base recipes.
- Add and format code templates for all recipes.
- Add favourites list.
