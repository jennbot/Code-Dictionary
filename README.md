# Design Recipe 

The application acts as a "design recipe" or dictionary of sorts for different coding languages. For example, say I was working on a java project, however, I had forgotten what an Arraylist looks like. By using this application, I would type in Arraylist and the application will output first the definition of an Arraylist, and then a code template of an Arraylist that the user can copy and paste onto their own project. Furthermore, the user will be able to save their own definitions or code templates into the dictionary, which will allow for quick and easy access to these templates.
